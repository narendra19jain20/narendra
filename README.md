+	dude,,,
+	
+	
+	sending you my first code,,,,,, it has some GUI code too, for java application,,,,
+	
+	The zip file contains the foolowing -
+	
+	1  GUI_Learning folder - it is a eclipse project, sidha eclipse main import kar sakta hia
+	
+	2  gson-2.0.jar and jsoup-1.7.3.jar -  jar files for the eclipse project,
+	
+	on how to run the project --
+	
+	
+	1) the main feching file is TestGoogleSea.java - jismain query deke sidha run kar sakte ho..... hard code kar do query string ko,,,
+	
+	2) yaa fir Main.java,,, jo ki java applicaiton launch karegaa, usmian ek text field hogi, query usmain likho and then click the button "Download_subs" at theb ottomo of the GUI,,,,,,  middle main text area hia, jo main socha tha to use to show the progress, so this is just pending thing........ 
+	
+	the main this is ki query asie honi chahiye jo ki subscene yaa tvsubtitle ke links search main top  main aa jaaye,,, abhi currently ye constraint ho raha hai due to the issue as I am only able to fetch 4 URLs,,,,,
+	
+	
+	baki apan discuss kar sakte hia on call......  but for example, you can try this query "How I met your Mother season 3 English subtitles"
+	
+	let's  begin this task, I will keep modify this thing,,,,  and ye without custom search engine hai, but custom wala bhi ismain add kar sakte hai not an issue...... will explain you,,,,,,,
